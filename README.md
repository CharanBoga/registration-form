### Registration Form

This repository hosts a lightweight registration form application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The form allows users to register by inputting basic details such as username, email, and password, with server-side validation to ensure data integrity. Passwords are securely encrypted using hashing techniques before being stored in a MongoDB database. With its simple setup and intuitive interface, this application serves as a foundational example for implementing user registration functionality in web applications.
